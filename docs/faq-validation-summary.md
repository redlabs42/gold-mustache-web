## How to Proceed with Manual Testing

### Step 1: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 2: Follow the Manual Testing Checklist

Open `docs/faq-manual-testing-checklist.md` and work through each section:

1. **Mobile Testing** - Test on actual iOS and Android devices
2. **Desktop Testing** - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
3. **Keyboard Navigation** - Use only keyboard to navigate
4. **Screen Readers** - Test with NVDA and VoiceOver
5. **Lighthouse Audit** - Run in Chrome DevTools
6. **Schema Validation** - Use Google Rich Results Test

### Step 3: Document Results

As you complete each test:
- Check off completed items in the checklist
- Document any issues found
- Take screenshots if needed
- Note browser/device-specific issues

### Step 4: Validate SEO Schema

1. Build the production version:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

2. Visit the page and view source
3. Copy the JSON-LD schema from the page
4. Validate at: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results

### Step 5: Run Lighthouse Audit

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Lighthouse tab
3. Select "Accessibility" category
